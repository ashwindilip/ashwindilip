- 👋 Hi, I’m Ashwin Dilip, a CSE graduate based in Bangalore, India.
- 👀 I’m interested in working with datasets to examine, clean, organize and transform data to gather insights and inform fruitful decision making. I also find interest in Data Science i.e. in anything that involves developing algorithms, building models and/or making predictions. Web development is another field that I find exciting. I find great satisfaction in creating seamless and engaging digital experiences. With my expertise in React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and Django, I am confident in my ability to make meaningful contributions by building robust, scalable, and user-centric applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work with the Tensorflow library in Python for training deep neural networks. My skillset in MongoDB (NoSQL) has gathered rust over time, so I've also been busy brushing it away!
- 💞️ I would love to collaborate on any projects/work that involve unearthing useful insights using data analysis tools or building and maintaining exciting web applications/software systems. If there are projects in other fields that you think might interest me, definitely feel free to hit me up. I have a curious mind (sometimes excessively, and to my detriment) and am a quick and commited learner. I like to say that all wondeful things are the result of innovative and productive collaboration. :)
- 😄 Pronouns: My pronouns are he/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: In addition to my interests in Computer Science, I also like to fiddle with creative writing. You can see snapshots of my writing at @ashwindilip47 om Instagram. Some of my favourite authors include Pynchon, Hemmingway and McCarthy.
